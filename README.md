# Archipelago

**Archipelago** is an atmospheric adventure game set in a mysterious and eerie archipelago. The player navigates between various islands, each with its own unique setting, challenges, and puzzles. The game combines exploration, survival, and puzzle-solving elements to create an immersive experience.

## Concept

The player travels among a handful of islands scattered across the vast ocean. Among these islands, there is a larger one that once hosted a fishing village, now dominated by a looming lighthouse. The lighthouse is central to the story, as it seems to be abandoned yet mysteriously follows the player. 

The goal of the game is to ascend the lighthouse, but the path to it is obstructed by puzzles and dangers spread across the different islands.

## Gameplay

- **Survival**: The player quickly learns that traveling over water is perilous, as they are hunted by creatures lurking beneath the surface. The player must avoid these dangers using a canoe or other means of transportation.
  
- **Puzzle-Solving**: As the player explores the islands, they encounter various puzzles and riddles that need to be solved to progress and ultimately reach the lighthouse.

- **Dynamic Environment**: The lighthouse isn't just a static object; it actively seeks out the player, adding a layer of tension and urgency to the exploration.

## The islands

- **The Old Fishing Village with the Lighthouse**: The main island, once a thriving village, now abandoned and overtaken by the looming lighthouse.
- **A Smaller Island**: Possibly hosting a small forest or another unique feature.
- **A Tiny Island with a Lone House**: An isolated, eerie setting that could hold important clues or puzzles.

## The Warden
The player is constantly pursued by a shadow-clad figure, named The Warden. A terrifying and relentless entity that haunts the islands. The wardenâ€™s presence is always felt, either through sound or sight, and the player must stay vigilant at all times. Using light and stealth, the player can temporarily repel the warden, but it is never truly gone. As the game progresses, the warden becomes more aggressive and harder to escape.

## Inspiration

The game's concept draws inspiration from atmospheric adventure games and eerie, isolated environments. The visual style and mood are inspired by works such as those found on Pinterest (as indicated in the reference link).
